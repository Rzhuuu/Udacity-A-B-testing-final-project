**Udacity A/B testing final project**

**Background:** Udacity offers a free online A/B testing course. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of A/B testing. This course demonstrated learners the knowledge and skills to design, implement, and analyze A/B tests in real-word scenarios. This page presents a walkthrough of the final project results.

**What is A/B testing?** A/B testing also known as split testing, is an experiment to compare two or more versions of a service to determine which one performs better.

**Why A/B testing?** A/B testing can help to make data-driven decision and optimize the service performance.

**How to conduct A/B testing?** A/B testing involves serval key steps: experiment design, metric choice, estimating baseline values of valuation metrics, experiment sizing, data analyzation, results and recommendation.

**Current stage:**

Udacity homepage overview presents two options:

1. Start free trial. If student clicks ‘start free trial’, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, then get enrolled in a free trial of the paid version of the course. After 14 days, the student will automatically be charged unless they cancel first.

2. Access course materials. If student clicks ‘access course materials’, they will be able to view the course content but receive no coaching or certificate, and they cannot get feedback after submitting final project.

**Future stage:**

If the student selected ‘start free trial’, they were prompt to specify the amount of time they could dedicate to the course each week. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, the checkout process is as usual. If they indicated less than 5 hours per week, a message would appear informing them that Udacity courses require more time commitment for successful completion. They would then be encouraged to access the course materials for free instead. The student had the choice to proceed with the free trial or opt to access the course materials for free. A screenshot demonstrating the updated page is provided.

**Hypothesis:**

By setting clearer expectations for student upfront, it would reduce the number of frustrated students who abandoned the free trial due to time constraints, while maintaining the number of students who continued past the free trial and completed the course. If the hypothesis proven true, this could enhance the overall student experience and optimize coaches capacity to support students who likely to complete the course.

**Unit of diversion:**

Cookies. However, once a student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked using their user ID. Each user ID can only enroll in the free trial once. If users do not enroll, their user ID is not included in the experiment data, even if they were logged in when they visited the course overview page.
